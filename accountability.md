# Accountability Teams
What if there were a way to improve your weekly progress towards any goal, that made use of the best knowledge we have on how humans learn and attain mastery? Well this isn't that. But maybe it's a step in the right direction.

## A dumb idea?
When I first heard the phrase accountability team, it didn't exactly fill me with joy. The phrase sounds like corporate jargon for "here is a new way to badger our employees." The word "accountability" can be taken to mean "who's fault is it?", and the word "team" sounds vaguely athletic, which certainly doesn't describe me. But at it's root, the idea behind the phrase made sense, and so I decided recently to form an accountability team and to see what would come of it.

As typically presented the concept is simple, almost boring. It refers to a small group of mentors or peers, to whom you periodically report on your progress in life. These wise people give you suggestions or commentary, which you then go and do your best to apply. Titans of industry, executives, the rich, powerful and ambitiious can all use these teams meetings to reach ever greater heights. And maybe, so could an aspiring developer like me.

<!-- I am a freelance web developer. And if that sounds impressive, let me be clear: the only reason I freelance is because I have not been able to get hired. Learning to program has been a long journey, and one I took on late in life. And I am in good company, part of a mass migration of people hoping to find a livelihood in the digital world. And many of us, maybe most of us, work alone. We find courses and tutorials, we dip in and out of slack chanels, we code after work, or on weekends, we build toy projects and piece together a portfolio we hope will convince an employer to give us a chance. We do all this alone. -->
<!-- 
Online communities and social networks can connect us to other developers, give us a platform to share and get help or feedback, and these are fantastic resources. But what I wanted was something different. I wanted a small group of tech savy people who would meet regularly for standups and code reviews, share our progress, discuss our roadblocks, and set goals for our next meeting. -->

<!-- Agile methodologies gave me a framework and the language for what I wanted. We would have standups, and each standup would be faciliated by a Scrum Master. Each participant would show the group what they are working on, address any challenges they had come across and tell us their goals for the next meeting. We call the interval between meetings a sprint. -->

<!-- The next step would be to find people to join me. I posted the idea of an accountability team on a slack channel at codebuddies.org. Over a few days, I got a few DM's asking to connect, and with that, we were off to the races.  Within a few days  we scheduled a video standup and had our first standup. Since then we have met three times, and settled on a regular schedule. -->


<!-- Here is the idea: get a team of developers together. It doesn't have to be a bunch of people, one or two is fine. In fact, a small group, fewer than 10 people is best for this kind of thing, otherwise it gets unwieldly. A couple of points to keep in mind:
1. Your likely respondents will be young, beginers and international.
1. most of these people will be beginners. employed developers will form there own professional networks and have contacts in the industry.
2. if you use a platform like FCC or codebuddies.org, most of your interested parties will be international.
4. it is likely your team will be all over the place in terms of tech, just because of the random nature of the project.
    - this limits the ability of participants to actually understand or comment on your particular code, and it limits the opportunity for collaboration and code reviews.
5. but it's easy and it's fun and there is allways a certain convergence around javascript. if they don't know it yet, they will soon.
6. what are the benefits? motivation, inspiration, connection, networking
7. You can use it as an opportunity to collaborate and use version control in an open source context.

Try it, and let me know how it goes. -->
